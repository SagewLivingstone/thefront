# To-do

- Randomize file name on upload - avoid collisions
- Save aspect ratio to model on upload
- Create day model that holds multiple images
- Create function that goes back and loads metadata for objects that don't have it

### Longer-term
- Switch front-end to react
- Switch from AWS -> Wasabi S3 for better pricing
