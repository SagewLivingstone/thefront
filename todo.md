# To-do

## Finish Before Moving On:
- Change calendar to start on Sundays instead of Monday
- Build a base layout template for pages
- Implement albums (for trips etc...)

## Longer-term
- Put a CDN in front of AWS, or switch to Wasabi
- Enable over-writing images AWS
- Create function that goes back and loads metadata for objects that don't have it
- Switch from AWS -> Wasabi S3 for better pricing
