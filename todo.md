# To-do

## Finish Before Moving On:
- Build a base layout template for pages
- Bug: Image timestamp on right images jumps to top
- Bug: Last day goes to nothing
- Implement albums (for trips etc...)

## Longer-term
- Put a CDN in front of AWS, or switch to Wasabi
- Create function that goes back and loads metadata for objects that don't have it
- Switch from AWS -> Wasabi S3 for better pricing
- Switch front-end to react? Or not.. i don't think i need it
